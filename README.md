# New Awesome

A site similar to vim-awesome. The purpose is to collect &
showcase all the available plugins.

Key features:
- Trying to be fully tested with travis build.
- Focus on community editting/contributing instead of scraping.
- Easily fetched/parsed json for plugin managers to use.

## Demo

To try the project out, I suggest using vagrant to fetch and provision an
image. Once provisioned, control the server with `bin/awe`.

## Inspiration

- [vim-awesome]: Awesome project built with datamining. I may lift some features.
- [plug-search]: My own plugin, lacking an appropriate database to be useful.
